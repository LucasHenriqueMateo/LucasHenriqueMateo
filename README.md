I am 25 years old, and I live in Sorocaba - São Paulo, Brazil. I am an engineer in control and automation and student at Data Science, Big DATA and Analytics. Artificial Intelligence enthusiast.

I am focusing on learning Python and R language, having taken several courses on digital platforms in search of knowledge in data science and AI.

I believe that in any area we must be in constant learning, and in the IT area I see that there is still a lot of development, new technologies and studies to be carried out, so I try to be always ahead and develop different skills in order to be always up to date with news in the area and be a better professional.
